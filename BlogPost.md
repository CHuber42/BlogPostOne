#Captain's Log, Sunday Feb 16

I'm starting on Epicodus' day 1 homework - part of which requires me to write a blog post.
It's suggested that I write about "my day, favorite food, favorite vacation destination, etc",
however I'm not really feeling that. 

I've started a habit of starting each day by going out for coffee, studying japanese for 30 min ~ 1 hr,
then switching over to my to-do list. Today that to-do list included the Epicodus work, which in turn leads to _this_.

As an experiment, I'm going to try to combine the Japanese HW in, and see if I can link in the kanji I've
been practicing:

Actually, it turns out I just need to install the _Japanese Language Pack_ in windows 10; we'll
see if Markdown supports kanji natively.

Let's add, then, the other elements I've learned:

* A leading "#" denotes a header. less is more: one # is the largest font, six # is the smallest.
* Bracketing "_" makes italics. As does bracketing "*"
* Bracketing "**" makes Bold.
* "[link text]"("link")" makes a hyperlink embedded in the link text.
* "!["image alt text"]"("Link") embeds an image on the page.
* "* " makes an unordered list (bullet points, as is used in this list)
* "N. " makes an ordered list, as in "1. X 2. Y 3. Z"

Kanji Library: 

* 日本語
* 話
* 六

There's an impromptu amateur poetry slam thing going on as I write this that makes it hard to focus.

Add'l: I'm done with this post. So, signing out.
